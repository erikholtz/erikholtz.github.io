    Hi! My name is Erik. I am a GIS/mapping contractor from San Luis Obispo, California.
    I thoroughly enjoy making maps and working with spatial data using the latest GIS tools.
    I like to keep busy with side projects on top of my day-to-day work, so I made this page to showcase some of those projects.
