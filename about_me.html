    Hi! My name is Erik. I am a GIS/mapping contractor from
    <br>San Luis Obispo, California. I enjoy making maps and
    <br>working with spatial data using a variety of mapping and design tools.
    <br>I like to keep busy with side projects on top of my day-to-day work,
    <br>so I made this page to showcase some of those projects.
